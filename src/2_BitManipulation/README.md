## Questions

- [x] Bit Manipulation
  - [x] Add two large number
    - Make number same size by adding zeroes
    - Add as string
    - For each digit, sum = (carry + num1[i] + num2[i]) % 10
    - For each digit, carry = Math.floor((carry + num1[i] + num2[i]) / 10)
    - If carry, add carry to result.
    - TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Given N check if ith bit is set.
    - (N >> i) & i == 1
    - N & (1 << i) != 0
    - N & (1 << i) == (1 << i)
    - TC: O(1), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Given N check if it is a power of 2.
    - N & (N - 1) == 0
    - TC: O(1), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Count set bits.
    - Iterate & increment count if ith bit is set.
    - TC: O(1), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Find unique number in array, every element appears twice except 1.
    - Take XOR of all elements
    - TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Find unique number in array, every element appears twice except 2.
    - XOR of all elements (= XOR of 2 unique element)
    - Divide array based on any set bit in XOR
    - TC: O(1), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Find unique number in array, every element appears thrice except 1.
    - Count frequency of each bit
    - Frequncy: 3x => unset bit
    - Frequncy: 3x + 1 => set bit
    - TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Find missing number in array which contains all distinct number from 1 to N+1
    - xor with 1 -> 1 to N+1
    - TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
  - [x] Sum of xor all pairs of elements in array
    - Add contribution by each bit multiply by 2 (lower + upper triangle, diagonal will have zero contribution)
    - Contribution by every single bit
    - X: number of element in which ith bit is set
    - Contribution = x _ (array_length - x) _ Math.pow(2, i)
    - TC: O(N), SC: O(1)
